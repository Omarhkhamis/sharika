          Although there is an international promotion of natural birth and the
          avoidance of C-section if not medically necessary, some women still
          try, as much as they could, to give birth by C-section, not because
          they like to go under the knife, but in an attempt to get longer
          leave. This is what happened with "Fatima Zaidan" from Efrin who was
          works for a Organization that is registered in Turkey and active in
          Northern Syria. "Zaidan" says, during our meeting with her, that she
          and her pregnant colleagues raise their hands in prayer for a delivery
          by C- section because maternity leave for natural birth does not
          exceed one week while for a C-section it is 15 days.
